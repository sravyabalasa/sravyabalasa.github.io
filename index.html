        <div class="descriptionint">Ever since picking up a camera in middle school, I've been obsessed. During high school, I opened up my photography business, where I take photos for proms, cotillions, graduation, portraits, you name it. However, I'm more than lucky that it's become more during my journey at UCSD. In the past year, I've worked at a portrait photography studio, joined a fashion magazine at UCSD, <a href="https://issuu.com/trenducsd" target=_blank>TREND</a>, as the photographer, and delved into styled conceptual shoots. Join me on my creative journey through my <a href="https://www.sravyabalasa.com/" target=_blank>photography portfolio</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/photoswithsravya" target=_blank>Instagram.</a></div>

        <div class="descriptionint">From a young age, I've written in cursive so, naturally, once I discovered the world of handlettering, I never left. I enjoy creating cards, painting wood rounds, designing posters, taking elaborate notes, drawing every type of abstract doodle or flower, you name it. Not only is it a creative, experimental outlet for me and therapeutic, but I cherish the smile it brings on faces with every gift I create. You can view more of my design work <a href="https://www.sravyabalasa.com/galleries/design" target=_blank>here.</a></div>

        <div class="descriptionint">I love to read. It started off with inhaling chapter books as a four year old to a couple books a week in my early teens. However, as of late, I've enjoyed reading books just analyzing the human lifestyle in addition to my usual young adult and Harry Potter agenda. Reccomendations: <i>I'll Give You The Sun, The Art of Loving, To Kill a Mockingbird, Jazz, Anna and the French Kiss, Before I Fall, Legend, Little Fires Everywhere</i></div>
        <div class="titleint">public speaking</div>
        <div class="descriptionint">I've always enjoyed writing and sharing my thoughts, but only recently did that come to fruition. I dove into public speaking with a goal to make an impact and be more articulate. If you're interested, here's my TEDx talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zokM87jgqaY" target=_blank>"Honest Communication in the Digital Age"</a>. Secondly, here's a speech about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfLkYPokPM" target=_blank>"The Truth About Passions"</a>, a topic that I hold very dear with ideas I live by.</div>
